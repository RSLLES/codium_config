I use the "local-sync" extension, which simply imports and exports Codium settings from an external folder:   https://open-vsx.org/extension/anweber/local-sync  
Everything is linked to a Git repository that I update across my different machines.

For external extensions (installed from another marketplace), use the `./install_external_extensions.sh` script.  
To update the Windows context menu, use `./contextual_menus.reg`.
